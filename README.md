## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a versatile software engineer with hands-on experience across backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and frontend frameworks. I’ve contributed to product development and low-latency trading systems at startups and research labs in North America and Asia.

With years of academic and professional experience in the U.S. and Canada, I’m fluent in English and experienced in cross-cultural and distributed team environments. My work spans cloud-native architectures, distributed systems, and decentralized applications, and has been deployed at production scale.
